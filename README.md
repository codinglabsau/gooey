# GOOEY
A collection of Vue components based on Tailwind, Shadcn-vue, and others.

## Documentation
The documentation is available in the `./app` directory. This serves as documentation, test target, and sandbox for prototyping.

```bash
vite
```

## Testing
Tests are implemented with Cypress, and can be run on CLI using `npm run tests`.  We are implementing end-to-end tests as most components are tested upstream.

For shadcn components, we do simple smoke tests to ensure they are not generating errors with basic usage.

For custom components, we are testing the functionality in depth.

## Security
If you discover any security related issues, create an issue on GitHub.
