# GOOEY
A private collection of Vue components for use in Coding Labs projects, based on Tailwind Shadcn-vue and others.

## Documentation
The documentation is gitignored, so it must be built locally. To do so, run:

```bash
npm run docs:build
cd docs/.vitepress/dist && herd link gooey-docs
```

The docs will now be available at [http://gooey-docs.test](http://ui-docs.test).

## Security
